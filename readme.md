# House of Burgundy game made by Sam Sinz

## Why I choose this game?

Having lived a few years in a village in Burgundy, I’ve always been amazed by the endless exploring opportunities of a seemingly boring place.
For this project, I’ve decided to develop a scavenger-hunt type game where the user needs to find my friend in the village. By discovering the village and its mysteries, the user finds important items and is given side quests by interesting characters.

## Key features

- Enthralling scenario and context
- User interactivity
- Smooth animations

## What's next?

- Comment and refactor
- Add locations, quests, items..
